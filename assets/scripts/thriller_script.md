# General Story Thriller Trailer

**Title: *The Lantern Point Protocol***

**Genre:** Crime / Thriller
**Tone:** Tense, atmospheric, grounded in realism

---

**Premise:**
On a storm-lashed cliff off the North Atlantic coast, a remote lighthouse known as Lantern Point doubles as a state-funded scientific research station studying oceanic climate change. Isolated from the mainland and reachable only by ferry once a week, the station houses only essential personnel. For years, the only inhabitants have been **Mara Voss** (30), a dedicated and methodical marine biologist, and **Elias Trenholm** (60), the aging lighthouse keeper whose encyclopedic knowledge of the sea is matched only by his reticence.

When **Theo Calder** (30), a quietly charming but enigmatic man, arrives to assist with new data systems, both Mara and Elias greet him warily. Theo claims to be from the mainland institute, assigned to help with a grant-funded expansion of the station‚Äôs capabilities.

---

**Key Characters:**

* **Mara Voss** ‚Äì Intelligent, guarded, and meticulous. She prefers data to people, and the lighthouse offers the solitude she craves. But she‚Äôs also deeply ethical‚Äîand when something doesn‚Äôt add up, she doesn‚Äôt let it go.

* **Elias Trenholm** ‚Äì Gruff, deeply rooted in the rhythms of the lighthouse, and not easily rattled. He‚Äôs lived through storms, shipwrecks, and worse. He doesn't talk much, but he sees everything.

* **Theo Calder** ‚Äì Disarming, well-versed in technical jargon, and seemingly helpful. But he‚Äôs oddly evasive about his background, and Mara begins to sense he‚Äôs not here just for research.

---

**Setting:**
The lighthouse is perched on a jagged, wave-pounded cliff. Inside, narrow metal corridors connect weathered labs, living quarters, and sealed storage bays. Flickering fluorescents and intermittent power cuts lend an eerie vulnerability. Outside, dense fog and howling wind cloak the surrounding waters. With no nearby settlements and only patchy radio contact with the mainland, any call for help could take hours‚Äîor longer‚Äîto be heard.

---

**Core Conflict:**
Shortly after Theo's arrival, Mara notices sealed areas of the facility she was never told about. A shipment of electronic equipment arrives without any corresponding paperwork. One of the station‚Äôs supply crates contains not oceanographic instruments, but industrial-grade tracking beacons. When Mara confronts Elias, he warns her to ‚Äúlet sleeping ghosts lie.‚Äù But Mara digs deeper‚Äîand finds encrypted files buried in the station‚Äôs data servers.

She begins to suspect the lighthouse is a waypoint in a high-level smuggling operation‚Äîpossibly involving rare minerals, arms, or even human cargo‚Äîhidden under the cover of government-funded science. And Theo? His credentials don‚Äôt check out. Yet someone is protecting him.

As Mara gets closer to the truth, surveillance systems fail. The ferry misses its scheduled drop. Elias grows distant. And Theo‚Äîwho may not be the only outsider‚Äîstarts asking questions of his own.

---

**Key Visual Moments:**

* **Mara, alone, staring through binoculars out at the vast, fog-covered sea**, her reflection barely visible in the glass as a distant ship idles just beyond the horizon.

* **Theo‚Äôs arrival**, the fog parting briefly as he steps off the ferry and approaches the lighthouse, greeted by Elias and Mara on the rain-slicked dock. The tension in their eyes is immediate‚Äîcordial, but wary.

---

**Themes:**
Isolation. Trust as a currency. The danger of institutional silence. When is it safer to know nothing?

**Tagline:**
*‚ÄúIn the loneliest place on earth, someone is watching. And someone is lying.‚Äù*

### ‚è±Ô∏è **0:00‚Äì0:10 ‚Äî ESTABLISHING ISOLATION**

**\[FADE IN: EXT. NORTH ATLANTIC ‚Äì OVERCAST ‚Äì DAY]**
*A drone shot arcs slowly over black, churning ocean. Jagged rocks claw out of the water. In the distance, the weather-beaten lighthouse rises from the cliff, its rust-streaked exterior flaking white in the salt air.*
**CAMERA:** Wide aerial, descending slightly, movement slow and foreboding.

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è **0:10‚Äì0:25 ‚Äî THE ARRIVAL AND UNSETTLING ROUTINE**

**\[INT. LIGHTHOUSE CORRIDOR ‚Äì DIM LIGHT ‚Äì DAY]**
*Mara (30, pale, sharp-featured, in a dark thermal turtleneck and rain-slick work pants) walks down a narrow metal corridor. Her boots echo against the steel floor. She pauses. A soft *clanging* echoes from the shaft below. Her breath clouds in the air. She listens. Doesn‚Äôt speak.*
**CAMERA:** Handheld behind Mara, slightly swaying ‚Äî claustrophobic.

**SOUND DESIGN:**

* Distant metallic banging ‚Äî irregular
* Electrical hum and the distant buzz of failing fluorescents

**\[EXT. DOCK ‚Äì FOGGY MORNING]**
*Theo Calder (30s, medium build, well-groomed beard, blue waterproof jacket too clean for this place) steps off the incoming ferry. Fog whips around his silhouette. Elias (60s, gaunt, wool cap, heavy oilskin coat) stands stone-faced beside Mara. They greet him stiffly ‚Äî Mara‚Äôs handshake is brief, eyes fixed. Theo smiles. It's too practiced.*
**CAMERA:** Steadicam dolly in on Theo. His arrival is framed like an intrusion.

**SOUND:**

* Ferry motor idles, distant
* Rain taps on metal surfaces
* A faint crackle from an overhead loudspeaker: static and a partial phrase‚Äî‚Äú‚Ä¶secure protocol‚Ä¶‚Äù

**NARRATOR (slightly closer, quieter now):**
*"And then‚Ä¶ there were four."*

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è **0:25‚Äì0:45 ‚Äî ESCALATION AND SUSPICION**

**\[INT. CONTROL ROOM ‚Äì NIGHT ‚Äì RED LIGHT]**
*Theo sits alone, lit only by monitors. Screens display grainy black-and-white CCTV feeds. One shows Mara asleep in her bunk. Another flickers ‚Äî static, then an empty hallway, then darkness.*
**CAMERA:** Push-in from behind, screen reflections ghosting across his face.

**SOUND DESIGN:**

* Electrical static
* Soft breathing
* A faint voice, unintelligible, layered deep in the audio mix

---

**\[INT. STOREROOM ‚Äì LOW LIGHT ‚Äì NIGHT]**
*Mara opens a sealed container. She wears gloves. Inside: tracking beacons labeled in Cyrillic and military-grade equipment. Her expression: frozen disbelief sliding into calculation.*
**CAMERA:** Extreme close-up on her eyes ‚Äî calculating, reflecting red warning lights.

**MUSIC:**

* High bowed strings begin to whine ‚Äî like pressure building in a hull
* Dissonance builds, layered with breathing

**DIALOGUE (quiet, flat):**
**MARA:**
*"This isn‚Äôt research gear."*

---

**\[INT. WINDOW ‚Äì DUSK ‚Äì SEA IN BACKGROUND]**
*Mara stands behind glass. Binoculars raised. Her breath fogs the window. Outside, in the mist: a dark freighter, anchored and idle, just beyond the fogline. No flag. No lights.*
**CAMERA:** Wide shot from outside. Her figure looks ghostly through the glass.

**NARRATOR (just above a whisper):**
*"Something moved beneath them‚Ä¶ or inside them."*

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è **0:45‚Äì0:55 ‚Äî THREAT MANIFESTS**

**\[INT. LIVING QUARTERS ‚Äì POWER OUT ‚Äì NIGHT]**
*Emergency lights pulse red. Mara moves fast through a hallway, flashlight jerking as she turns. Behind her, a shape disappears around a corner. She stops. Listens. Nothing.*
**CAMERA:** Low angle, handheld, tight framing ‚Äî adrenaline pace.

**\[EXT. CLIFF ‚Äì NIGHT ‚Äì FOG HEAVY]**
*A figure ‚Äî too still ‚Äî stands on the edge of the rocks, facing the ocean. Unmoving. Elias watches from the lighthouse window. He doesn‚Äôt blink.*
**SOUND:**

* One soft sonar ping
* Wind drops into total silence

**DIALOGUE (barely audible whisper, terrified):**
**MARA (V.O.):**
*"I think‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre not alone."*

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è **0:55 ‚Äî FINAL IMAGE / TEXT CARD**

**\[THERMAL SURVEILLANCE CAMERA ‚Äì STATIC PULSE]**
\*The screen shows three human-shaped heat signatures in a room‚Ä¶ and one fourth figure outside, on the rocks. The fourth is colder, barely registering. It doesn‚Äôt move. The image stutters‚Äî*then cuts to black.*

**TEXT ON SCREEN ‚Äî WHITE ON BLACK (minimal, sharp cut):**
***THE LIGHT BENEATH***
*COMING SOON*

**SOUND:**

* Sharp *metal latch*
* Total blackout
* Faint underwater *groan* like hull steel under pressure

**MUSIC:**

* One high-pitched tone breaks ‚Äî then decays into static

Sharp close-up on her eyes. | Strings tighten, dry bow strokes            | Clank of crate latch, distant metal groan      | Red overhead lighting. Mara silent, breath audible.
