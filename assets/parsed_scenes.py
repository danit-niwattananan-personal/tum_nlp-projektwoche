genre_prefixes = {
    "fantasy": "The trailer is a somber, atmospheric fantasy set on a storm-lashed northern coast, where a remote lighthouse conceals ancient secrets beneath the waves. The tone is quiet and eerie — more mystery than horror — with naturalistic magic, fog-laced visuals, and haunting maritime lore. Music and sound should evoke loneliness, creeping unease, and the slow, tidal pull of something ancient remembering itself. Avoid bombast — favor subtlety, texture, and emotional depth.",
    "romance": "The trailer is a quiet, emotionally intimate romance set at a remote lighthouse surrounded by endless sea. The mood is gentle, restrained, and reflective — steeped in solitude, slow connection, and buried longing. Music and sound should convey warmth beneath stillness, vulnerability beneath routine, and the ache of unspoken feelings. Avoid melodrama or sweeping gestures — favor soft textures, subtle melodies, and the delicate tension between distance and desire.",
    "thriller":"The trailer is a grounded thriller set in a remote North Atlantic lighthouse, with an eerie, tense, and atmospheric mood. The setting is isolated, battered by storms and fog, with flickering lights, hidden corridors, and an overwhelming sense of unease. Music and sound should enhance the suspense, mystery, and growing paranoia as secrets unfold in an unforgiving environment. "
