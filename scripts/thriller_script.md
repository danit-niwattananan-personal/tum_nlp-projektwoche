# General Story Thriller Trailer

**Title: *The Lantern Point Protocol***

**Genre:** Crime / Thriller
**Tone:** Tense, atmospheric, grounded in realism

---

**Premise:**
On a storm-lashed cliff off the North Atlantic coast, a remote lighthouse known as Lantern Point doubles as a state-funded scientific research station studying oceanic climate change. Isolated from the mainland and reachable only by ferry once a week, the station houses only essential personnel. For years, the only inhabitants have been **Mara Voss** (30), a dedicated and methodical marine biologist, and **Elias Trenholm** (60), the aging lighthouse keeper whose encyclopedic knowledge of the sea is matched only by his reticence.

When **Theo Calder** (30), a quietly charming but enigmatic man, arrives to assist with new data systems, both Mara and Elias greet him warily. Theo claims to be from the mainland institute, assigned to help with a grant-funded expansion of the station’s capabilities.

**Key Characters:**

* **Mara Voss** – Intelligent, guarded, and meticulous. She prefers data to people, and the lighthouse offers the solitude she craves. But she’s also deeply ethical—and when something doesn’t add up, she doesn’t let it go.

* **Elias Trenholm** – Gruff, deeply rooted in the rhythms of the lighthouse, and not easily rattled. He’s lived through storms, shipwrecks, and worse. He doesn't talk much, but he sees everything.

* **Theo Calder** – Disarming, well-versed in technical jargon, and seemingly helpful. But he’s oddly evasive about his background, and Mara begins to sense he’s not here just for research.

**Setting:**
The lighthouse is perched on a jagged, wave-pounded cliff. Inside, narrow metal corridors connect weathered labs, living quarters, and sealed storage bays. Flickering fluorescents and intermittent power cuts lend an eerie vulnerability. Outside, dense fog and howling wind cloak the surrounding waters. With no nearby settlements and only patchy radio contact with the mainland, any call for help could take hours—or longer—to be heard.

---

**Core Conflict:**
Shortly after Theo's arrival, Mara notices sealed areas of the facility she was never told about. A shipment of electronic equipment arrives without any corresponding paperwork. One of the station’s supply crates contains not oceanographic instruments, but industrial-grade tracking beacons. When Mara confronts Elias, he warns her to “let sleeping ghosts lie.” But Mara digs deeper—and finds encrypted files buried in the station’s data servers.

She begins to suspect the lighthouse is a waypoint in a high-level smuggling operation—possibly involving rare minerals, arms, or even human cargo—hidden under the cover of government-funded science. And Theo? His credentials don’t check out. Yet someone is protecting him.

As Mara gets closer to the truth, surveillance systems fail. The ferry misses its scheduled drop. Elias grows distant. And Theo—who may not be the only outsider—starts asking questions of his own.

---

**Key Visual Moments:**

* **Mara, alone, staring through binoculars out at the vast, fog-covered sea**, her reflection barely visible in the glass as a distant ship idles just beyond the horizon.

* **Theo’s arrival**, the fog parting briefly as he steps off the ferry and approaches the lighthouse, greeted by Elias and Mara on the rain-slicked dock. The tension in their eyes is immediate—cordial, but wary.

**Themes:**
Isolation. Trust as a currency. The danger of institutional silence. When is it safer to know nothing?

**Tagline:**
*“In the loneliest place on earth, someone is watching. And someone is lying.”*
